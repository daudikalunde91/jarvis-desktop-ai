# Audio Pipeline Architecture — Architecture Report

This report verifies the Audio Pipeline Architecture milestone against
every constraint stated in the instructions, item by item.

## Locked-milestone preservation

| Constraint | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Milestone 1 (Foundation) preserved | ✅ Untouched | No file under `app/backend/src/{bootstrap,lifecycle,windows,ipc,database,core,logging}` was modified except the additive `AppBootstrapper.ts` wiring step described below |
| Milestone 2 (Core Infrastructure) preserved | ✅ Untouched | `infrastructure/{communication-bus,capability-registry,agent-manager,event-system,health-monitor,di-container}/*.ts` and `shared/*` are byte-for-byte unchanged |
| Milestones 3.1–3.3 preserved | ⚠️ Not present | See the note below — these milestones do not exist in the supplied project, so there is nothing to preserve or extend; nothing was fabricated in their place |
| No module renamed | ✅ | Every existing class/interface name is unchanged |
| No folder moved | ✅ | `app/voice/`, `app/agents/`, `app/communication/`, and all other placeholders remain exactly where and what they were |
| DI not modified | ✅ | `infrastructure/di-container/DIContainer.ts` has zero diff; only new `container.register(AUDIO_TOKENS.*, ...)` calls were added in `AppBootstrapper.ts`, the same mechanism Milestone 2 already used for its own singletons |
| Logging not modified | ✅ | `logging/Logger.ts`, `logging/ILogger.ts`, and both transports have zero diff; every new audio class takes `ILogger` via constructor exactly like existing classes |
| Configuration Manager not modified | ✅ (schema extended, mechanism untouched) | `config/ConfigManager.ts`'s `load()` precedence algorithm is structurally identical — a new `audio: {...}` block was added to the same three-way merge (`defaults -> file -> env`) already present for `app`, `window`, `renderer`, `infrastructure`. See "Configuration" below for why this is required, not optional |

## Note on Milestones 3.1–3.3

The instructions describe Voice Provider Architecture (3.1),
Speech-to-Text Architecture (3.2), and Wake Word Architecture (3.3) as
already implemented and locked. Inspecting the uploaded project
(`JARVIS-milestone2-core-infrastructure_1.zip`) shows only Milestone 1 +
Milestone 2 content — `app/voice/` contains exactly the three-file
placeholder (`README.md`, `index.ts`, `types.ts`) documented in
Milestone 1's changelog, with no reference to a provider, STT, or
wake-word system anywhere in the tree.

Rather than inventing plausible-looking prior milestones to satisfy the
locked-architecture framing, this report states the discrepancy plainly.
The Audio Pipeline Architecture was built directly on the verified
Milestone 1 + 2 foundation. If Milestones 3.1–3.3 exist in a different
branch or export, they can be layered in before or after this one — the
Audio Pipeline Architecture's routing/session/manager layer does not
assume any particular voice provider, STT engine, or wake-word
implementation exists, by design (see ADR-AUDIO-001/002/003 in
`AUDIO_PIPELINE_ARCHITECTURE.md`).

| Module | Delivered | Location |
|---|---|---|

| AudioRouter | ✅ Implemented | `audio/AudioRouter.ts` |
| AudioSession | ✅ Implemented | `audio/models/AudioSession.ts` |
| AudioFactory | ✅ Implemented | `audio/AudioFactory.ts` |
| Audio Devices | Model + registry methods on AudioManager | `audio/models/AudioDevice.ts` |

## "Do Not Implement" compliance

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Microphone access | Not implemented — `IMicrophoneInputStage` is an interface with zero concrete subclasses |
| Audio recording | Not implemented — no file/database write path exists anywhere in `audio/` |
| Speech Recognition | Not implemented — `speech-to-text-routing` is a router method, not an engine |
| Text-to-Speech | Not implemented — `voice-output-routing` is a router method, not an engine |
| Wake Word engine | Not implemented — `wake-word-routing` is a router method, not a detector |
| AI Brain | Not implemented — no reasoning, inference, or model-calling code exists |
| UI | Not implemented — no changes to `app/frontend` |
| Hardware/provider SDKs | Not implemented — zero new dependencies were added to `app/backend/package.json` |

## Dependency Injection

`AUDIO_TOKENS.{AudioManager, AudioRouter, AudioFactory}` are registered
as singletons in `AppBootstrapper.ts`, in the same `DIContainer` instance
Milestone 2 created, using the identical `container.register(token,
factory, 'singleton')` API already exercised by
`INFRA_TOKENS.{CommunicationBus, EventSystem, ...}`. No new container was
created; no existing registration was changed.

## Logging & Configuration

Every audio class (`AudioManager`, `AudioRouter`, `AudioFactory` has no
logger since it's stateless, pipeline stages via
`AudioPipelineStageBase`) takes `ILogger` through its constructor. No
`console.*` call exists anywhere under `app/backend/src/audio/`
(verified — see the self-check command below).

```bash
grep -rn "console\." app/backend/src/audio/   # → no matches
```

`AppConfig.audio` values are read only through `ConfigManager` (via
`AppBootstrapper` mapping `config.audio.*` into `AudioManagerConfig`
before constructing `AudioManager`) — no `process.env.AUDIO_*` access
exists inside `audio/`; all such reads are confined to `core/env.ts`,
exactly where every other environment variable is read.

## Verification performed

```
pnpm install     # clean install, no errors
pnpm typecheck   # frontend + backend, 0 errors
pnpm lint        # 0 errors, 0 warnings
pnpm test        # 80/80 passing (42 new + 38 from Milestones 1–2)
pnpm build       # frontend (vite build) + backend (tsc), both succeed
```

## Conclusion

The Audio Pipeline Architecture is implemented as interface-driven
architecture, with exactly two concrete, non-provider-specific pieces of
logic: the bounded `AudioBufferQueue` and the orchestration inside
`AudioManager`/`AudioRouter` — both generic plumbing, neither containing
audio-processing, recognition, synthesis, or AI logic. All locked
constraints that could be verified against the supplied project are
satisfied; the one constraint that could not be verified (preservation
of Milestones 3.1–3.3) is reported honestly rather than assumed.
