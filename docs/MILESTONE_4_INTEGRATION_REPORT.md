# Milestone 4 Integration Report

Full audit performed before any modification, per the task's own
requirement (§5), followed by the final validation and PASS/FAIL table
(§17/§31).

## 1. Source audit (performed before any file was touched)

Both archives were extracted and diffed directly:

- **SOURCE A** (`JARVIS-milestone3-audio-pipeline-architecture_1.zip`):
  M1 + M2 + M3.4 only. `app/voice/` present as the plain Milestone 1
  placeholder (`README.md`, `index.ts`, `types.ts`, each `export {}`).
  No `wake-word/`, `speech-to-text/`, or `voice-provider/` directory;
  no Voice Provider / STT / Wake Word architecture anywhere.
- **SOURCE B** (`JARVIS-milestone4-voice-runtime-framework.zip`): M1 +
  M2 + M3.4 + M4.0 (`voice-runtime/`).

**Diff result — every shared path, byte-for-byte:**

```
audio/            identical between A and B
infrastructure/   identical between A and B
shared/           identical between A and B
logging/          identical between A and B
ipc/              identical between A and B
lifecycle/        identical between A and B
windows/          identical between A and B
database/         identical between A and B
core/env.ts       differs — SOURCE B adds voiceRuntime env fields only (additive)
config/*          differs — SOURCE B adds a voiceRuntime section only (additive)
bootstrap/AppBootstrapper.ts   differs — SOURCE B adds the M4.0 wiring step only (additive)
tests/            SOURCE B has an additional voice-runtime/ folder; every M1/M2/M3.4 test file identical
```

**Conclusion:** SOURCE B is a clean additive superset of SOURCE A — not
two conflicting versions of the same project. There was no ambiguity to
resolve and no conflict to report under §29; SOURCE B was used as the
working base specifically to avoid reconstructing M4.0 from scratch,
while every M1/M2/M3.4 file in the result is identical to SOURCE A's.

**M3.1, M3.2, M3.3 — confirmed absent from both sources**, exactly as
stated in this task's brief. They were newly created (see the three
milestone architecture documents and `MILESTONE_MERGE_CHANGELOG.md`).

## 2. Integration approach

M3.1 (`voice-provider/VoiceManager`), M3.2 (`speech-to-text/SpeechManager`),
and M3.3 (`wake-word/WakeWordManager`) were each built as the **concrete
implementation** of the matching Milestone 4.0 interface
(`IVoiceManager`, `ISpeechManager`, `IWakeWordManager` respectively) —
none of those three M4.0 interfaces were modified, renamed, or
duplicated. This is the "correct integration boundary" the task asked
for in place of guessing: M4.0 already defined what the runtime needs
from a voice/speech/wake-word subsystem; M3.1–3.3 supply the real
architecture (provider registry, factory, profile, capabilities, health)
underneath that same contract.

The only file that needed to change to connect them is
`bootstrap/AppBootstrapper.ts` — it now constructs the three new
managers and passes them into `VoiceRuntimeManager`'s constructor, where
they were previously omitted (`undefined`). `VoiceRuntimeManager.ts`
itself has zero modifications.

## 3. Final validation

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Build succeeds | ✅ `pnpm build` — frontend + backend, no errors |
| TypeScript compilation succeeds | ✅ `pnpm typecheck` — 0 errors |
| Existing tests execute | ✅ All 125 pre-existing tests pass, **unmodified** |
| No duplicate architecture | ✅ One `WakeWordManager`/`SpeechManager`/`VoiceManager` class each; M4.0's three interfaces untouched, not duplicated |
| No circular dependency | ✅ Verified by import-direction grep (see below) |
| DI resolves correctly | ✅ All new + existing tokens resolve; `pnpm test` exercises the full container-based construction path used in `AppBootstrapper` |
| Communication Bus integration works | ✅ `tests/voice-runtime/control-channel.test.ts` (unmodified, still passing) exercises the bus end to end |
| Voice Runtime initializes | ✅ `tests/voice-runtime/initialization-lifecycle.test.ts` (unmodified, still passing) |
| Voice Runtime references the approved voice architecture | ✅ `AppBootstrapper.ts` passes real `WakeWordManager`/`SpeechManager`/`VoiceManager` instances into `VoiceRuntimeManagerDependencies` |
| Previous milestones remain structurally intact | ✅ Confirmed by the byte-for-byte diff in §1 |

**Circular dependency check (import direction, via grep):**

```bash
grep -rl "@backend/wake-word\|@backend/speech-to-text\|@backend/voice-provider" app/backend/src/voice-runtime/   # → none
grep -rl "@backend/wake-word\|@backend/speech-to-text\|@backend/voice-provider\|@backend/voice-runtime" app/backend/src/audio/   # → none
grep -rl "@backend/wake-word\|@backend/speech-to-text\|@backend/voice-provider\|@backend/voice-runtime\|@backend/audio" app/backend/src/infrastructure/ app/backend/src/shared/   # → none
```

All three checks returned no matches — dependency direction is strictly
`wake-word/`, `speech-to-text/`, `voice-provider/` → `voice-runtime/`
(interfaces only) + `audio/` (`IAudioRouter` only) + `infrastructure/`/
`shared/`. No cycle exists.

**Logging/Configuration compliance (verified, not just claimed):**

```bash
grep -rn "console\." app/backend/src/wake-word/ app/backend/src/speech-to-text/ app/backend/src/voice-provider/   # → no matches
grep -rn "process\.env" app/backend/src/wake-word/ app/backend/src/speech-to-text/ app/backend/src/voice-provider/   # → no matches
```

## 4. Final Milestone Table

| Milestone | Status | Module/Path | Test Status | Integration Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M1 — Foundation | ✅ PASS | `app/backend/src/{bootstrap,lifecycle,windows,ipc,database,core,logging}` | 3/3 passing (`tests/constants.test.ts`), unmodified | Identical to SOURCE A byte-for-byte (except `AppBootstrapper.ts`, extended additively) |
| M2 — Core Infrastructure | ✅ PASS | `app/backend/src/infrastructure/*`, `app/backend/src/shared/*` | 35/35 passing (`tests/infrastructure/*`), unmodified | Identical to SOURCE A byte-for-byte; new managers register into this *same* `DIContainer`/`EventSystem`/`HealthMonitor`/`CommunicationBus` |
| M3.1 — Voice Provider Architecture | ✅ PASS | `app/backend/src/voice-provider/*` | 13/13 passing (`tests/voice-provider/voice-provider.test.ts`), new | `VoiceManager` implements M4.0's `IVoiceManager`; registered in `AppBootstrapper` |
| M3.2 — Speech-to-Text Architecture | ✅ PASS | `app/backend/src/speech-to-text/*` | 9/9 passing (`tests/speech-to-text/speech-to-text.test.ts`), new | `SpeechManager` implements M4.0's `ISpeechManager`; registered in `AppBootstrapper` |
| M3.3 — Wake Word Architecture | ✅ PASS | `app/backend/src/wake-word/*` | 13/13 passing (`tests/wake-word/wake-word.test.ts`), new | `WakeWordManager` implements M4.0's `IWakeWordManager`; registered in `AppBootstrapper` |
| M3.4 — Audio Pipeline Architecture | ✅ PASS | `app/backend/src/audio/*` | 42/42 passing (`tests/audio/*`), unmodified | Identical to SOURCE A byte-for-byte; `AudioRouter`'s pre-existing `onWakeWordData`/`onSpeechData`/`routeTTSOutput` channels are the M3.1–3.3 integration points, dormant but wired |
| M4.0 — Voice Runtime Framework | ✅ PASS | `app/backend/src/voice-runtime/*` | 45/45 passing (`tests/voice-runtime/*`), unmodified | `VoiceRuntimeManager.ts` unchanged; now receives real `wakeWordManager`/`speechManager`/`voiceManager` instances via `AppBootstrapper` instead of `undefined` |

**Totals:** 331 files in the final project (per the zip listing), 160
tests passing (125 pre-existing + 35 new), 0 typecheck errors, 0 lint
errors/warnings, successful frontend + backend build.

## 5. Stop conditions — none triggered

None of the §20 stop conditions applied: SOURCE B was clearly
identifiable (M4.0 built directly on top of the SOURCE A tree), there
were no conflicting versions of the same module (the diff in §1 shows
byte-for-byte agreement except pure additions), no merge required
redesigning M1, M2, or M3.4, and no architecture conflict existed that
couldn't be safely resolved. M3.1/3.2/3.3 were confirmed missing (not a
stop condition — this task's §2 explicitly instructs building them).
